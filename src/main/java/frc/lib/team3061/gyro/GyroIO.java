/**
 * Gyro hardware abstraction interface
 *
 * <p>The Gyro is modeled not as a subsystem but rather a shared resource that may be used by
 * multiple subsystems. Since it doesn't have a periodic method like a subsystem, it is important
 * that its updateInputs method is called just once via another periodic method. (This requires some
 * coordination, and, in this library, it is invoked via the drivetrain subsystem's periodic
 * mehtod.)
 *
 * <p>There is not a simulated version of this interface. Instead, the drivetrain supports
 * determining the robot's rotation from the gryo when connected and via the swwerve module
 * positions when not connected.
