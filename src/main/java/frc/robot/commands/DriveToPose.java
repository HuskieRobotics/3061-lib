   * Constructs a new DriveToPose command that drives the robot in a straight line to the specified
   * target pose.
   *
   * @param drivetrain the drivetrain subsystem required by this command
   * @param targetPoseSupplier a supplier that returns the pose to drive to. A pose supplier is
   *     specified instead of a pose since the target pose may not be known when this command is
   *     created. In addition, for more complex applications, this provides the opportunity for the
   *     target pose to change while this command executes.
   * @param xSupplier a function that takes the current and target x positions in the field frame
   *     and returns the x velocity in the field frame to drive at. The function should return a
   *     value in meters per second. Most commonly, this will be be calculated by a PID controller.
   * @param ySupplier a function that takes the current and target y positions in the field frame
   *     and returns the y velocity in the field frame to drive at. The function should return a
   *     value in meters per second. Most commonly, this will be be calculated by a PID controller.
   *     However, this enables other approaches such as fusing driver input (like was done in 2025
   *     when aligning to the barge).
   * @param thetaSupplier a function that takes the current and target theta positions and returns
   *     the theta velocity to drive at. The function should return a value in radians per second.
   *     Most commonly, this will be be calculated by a PID controller.
   * @param targetTolerance the tolerance for determining if the robot has reached the target pose
   *     specified in meters. This tolerance is specified in the frame of the target pose, not in
   *     the field frame. If more complex logic is needed, the isPoseWithinTolerance method can be
   *     overriden (e.g., for asymmetric tolerances).
   * @param finishesWhenAtTarget if true, this command will finish when the robot is at the target
   *     pose (within the specified tolerances). If false, this command will not finish when the
   *     robot is at the target pose, but will continue until another condition is met (e.g.,
   *     timeout, cannot reach target pose, move-to-pose feature disabled) or the command is
   *     canceled.
   * @param atTargetConsumer a consumer that is invoked with a boolean indicating whether the robot
   *     is at the target pose (within the specified tolerances). This can be used to change LEDs to
   *     indicate to the driver that the robot is at the target pose.
   * @param poseDifferenceConsumer a consumer that is invoked with the pose difference in the frame
   *     of the target pose. This can be used in more complicated collections of commands to control
   *     other subsystems as the robot moves towards the target pose.
   * @param timeout the timeout in seconds for this command. If the timeout is reached, this command
   *     will finish. If the timeout is less than or equal to zero, this command will not time out.
   *     This is useful for debugging purposes, but should be set to a reasonable value in
   *     production code to prevent the robot from driving indefinitely.
